For my CMU 15-112 Term Project, I created "Sudoku" with a duck face/emoji that changes expressions based on how much of the board is filled. Run the "tp" file in an editor such as VS code. I only imported cmu_graphics, random, os, pathlib, and copy as libraries.
Don't forget cmu graphics folder and tp-starter-files folder.
Use H to use hint 1, which highlights a cell with only one legal for the first level and actually fills it for the second level.
Use J to autoplay all singletons.
H and J can only be used on boards that are correct thusfar.
Use L to display possible Legals.
Use R to show wrong cells, which will display red dots in the bottom right of wrong cells.
